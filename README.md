# Mohasebe_Deltab2-4ac
This Python program calculates a quadratic equation. This project is suitable for learning basic Python concepts, mathematical operations, and conditional statements.

The program takes three inputs from the user and calculates the discriminant (Δ = b² - 4ac) of the quadratic equation.

In this project, the three inputs are predefined, but the program is also designed so that the user can enter any three numbers using the input function.

Based on the value of the discriminant, the type of roots is determined.


Δ > 0 → Two different roots
Δ = 0 → One real root
Δ < 0 → Two complex roots

Why is this project useful and practical?

* Because it helps in learning the basic Python syntax and mathematical operations.

* It provides practice with using conditional statements to check the type of roots.

* It serves as a foundation for more advanced projects in mathematical and scientific programming.
